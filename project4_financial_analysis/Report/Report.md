                          #Financial Market Analysis – Project Report

Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing financial market data to understand stock price trends, evaluate   
portfolio performance, and assess investment risk using Python-based data analysis techniques.

Objectives

• Analyze historical stock price trends
• Evaluate portfolio performance
• Assess investment risk using statistical measures
• Visualize financial data for insights

Dataset Description

The project uses CSV datasets including stock_prices.csv for historical stock data and portfolio.csv
for portfolio allocation details.

Tools and Technologies

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook were used for analysis and 
visualization.

Methodology

Data was loaded and preprocessed, stock trends were visualized, portfolio returns were calculated
using weighted averages, and risk was assessed using volatility measures.

Results and Insights

Diversified portfolios showed reduced risk compared to individual stocks. Higher returns were
generally associated with higher volatility.

Conclusion

The project demonstrates how data-driven techniques can be applied to financial markets to
support informed investment decisions.
