                          #Sports Analytics Project Report
#Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sports match data to evaluate team performance and predict
match outcomes using machine learning techniques. A Logistic Regression model was used for
match outcome prediction based on team scores, venue, and team identifiers.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains match-level information including teams involved, scores, venue, and match
winner. Categorical variables were encoded and missing values were handled before model
training.

#Methodology
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature engineering and label encoding
3. Train-test split
4. Logistic Regression model training
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

#Model & Evaluation
Logistic Regression with the liblinear solver was used due to the small dataset size. Model
performance was evaluated using accuracy and classification report metrics.
Conclusion
The project demonstrates how data preprocessing and basic machine learning models can be
applied to sports analytics. With a larger dataset, more advanced models could further improve prediction accuracy.
